## Network types and standards.

## Different types of networks
 ### Peer-based
 #### benefits
 The main benefit of a peer to peer network is that it is easier to set up. Another in peer-to-peer networks all nodes are act as server as well as client therefore no need of dedicated server. Another benefit of peer to peer network is that is one of the cheapest types of networks to use. Peer to peer network is easier to set up and use this means that you can spend less time in the configuration and implementation of peer to peer network. It is not requiring for the peer to peer network to use the dedicated server computer. Any computer on the network can function as both a network server and a user workstation.

 #### resource implications
 the resources needed to implement a peer to peer network is two or more PC's both with internet connection.
 
 #### communications 
 communications between the two PC's can be anything that can be transferred from one PC to another.
 
 #### working practice 
 The work practise that would need to be done on a peer to peer network will be minimal because a peer to peer network is a simple network that does not have many complex issues or requirements to handle.
 
 #### commercial opportunity 
 Peer to peer networking allows for commercial opportunities such as being able to work with other members of the business by sharing files and data between them seamlessly using the network with little risk of data being intercepted by outside sources.
 
 #### information sharing 
 information can be shared easily on a peer to peer network as long at the receiving and sending PC are on the same network. The information that is being sent does have a chance of being corrupted if it is intercepted by other data during its transit to the receiving PC. 
 
 ### client-server 
A client-server is a network in which many clients are connect to a higher client which acts as a server which directs traffic and connects all the clients together. This is the basic type of client-server network that are most commonly seen in business and organizations.
 #### benefits
There are many benefits to client-server networks. Some of these benefits are:

* All files are stored in a central location

* Network peripherals are controlled centrally

* Backups and network security is controlled centrally

* Users can access shared data which is centrally controlled

#### resource implications 
 The resources that will be needed for this network to be implemented would be the client PC's and a main client to act as the server to connect the network together. The clients are connected to each other and information and data is transmitted from/to each client.
 #### communications 
 Communication on the network works differently than a server network. On a client-server the clients on the network communicate with each other directly.
 #### commercial opportunity 
 The commercial opportunity that client-server offers to business and companies is a simple network connection between each client's PC to allow the exchange of data and information between each client.
 #### information sharing 
 information sharing on a client server is very similar to peer to peer network in which it allows all clients on the server to communicate to each other using data and information which is sent to each client's PC to and from a main client called a server.
 ### cloud
A Cloud network is a virtual network that can be accessed by an internet connection. This cloud network can belong to a private company or an open group and will act as a virtual network for that business with its own vital firewall, server and router. A could network can also be known as an internet based network.
  #### benefits
There are many benefits of using a cloud network. Here are some of the benefits:

* Reduce maintenance cost for upkeep

* The scalability of a cloud network can be nearly endless with the amount of data and information it can hold. Cloud networks don't take up much physical space and still maintaining a massive network size and capacity.

* The cloud allows for easy communication and ease of use when accessing or uploading data to the network from any wireless access point connected to the network.

 #### resource implications
 The resources needed to implement a cloud network are a router to connect an existing network or a device to the cloud network and the hardware needed to host the virtual network on.
 
 #### communications 
 The cloud network will allow for fast and easy ways to communicate from one client's device to another. This is because it is wireless which allows users to communicate from anywhere which is connected to the network through the internet.
 
#### working practice 
 The cloud network allows for a safe working practice because most cloud networks contain a virtual firewall which should protect from any unwanted software. 

#### commercial opportunity 
  There are a lot of commercial opportunity for a business if they own a cloud server they can sell the user of them could network to outside users for a fee. The company will also be allowed to set up anywhere in the world with an internet connection and still access their file and data stored on the cloud.

#### information sharing 
 Information sharing will be allowing easier on a cloud network without needing a wired connection to the network and being able to access the information from anywhere with an internet connection.
 
 ### cluster
A cluster network is a network in which all the nodes (client used as a server) on the network are set to the same task with each one running their own instance of an operating system. The cluster network is similar to most networks however it is more scattered then most networks meaning some device maybe perform the same tasks as other not making it the most efficient network but making it a working network nonetheless.

 #### benefits
 * a cluster server can host more the one server which handles the same task, so if one server was to go down the other server can take its place to prevent any problems until the first server's issue is fix.
 
 * The cluster network is complete scalable which means that it can be used for small networks and large networks by adding more devices or less devices respectively.
 
* When a server is down for maintenance another server can take its position to make maintenance easier while still keeping the network up for the clients.

 #### resource implications 
The resources that are needed to create a cluster network are the clients which access the network one or more servers to direct traffic around the network and a router to connect to other networks.
 
 #### communications 
 communication is like any other network in which a message can be sent from one PC on the network to another PC on the network through the network's server(s).
 
 #### information sharing
information sharing on a cluster network can work like any other network but can be slow at times when multiple packets of data intercept each other by having all the clients connected to each other as well as the server but it could also allow for fast transport for the data package if the destination client in nearby on the system.
 
### centralised
A centralised network is when all clients and devices on the network are connected to a main server. This main server holds all the information on the clients and devise and the conversations that they produce.
 #### resource implications 
 The resources what will be needed for this network to be implemented would be the clients and the main server which holds all the information and communication.
 
#### communications 
 The communications that are created on the network are stored on the main server which handles all the things about the network.
 
 #### working practice 
 The working practice for this network is that all the conversations and information is passed through the server which can them check for any unwanted or inappropriate content allowed on and out of the network.
 #### information sharing 
information can be shared throughout the network but it has to pass through and stored on the main server which can then be seen later on for monetisation and review.
 
### virtualized
 virtualized networks are a mix of both a virtual network and a LAN network (VLAN). These types of networks are common with large corporations which use this network to get the best of both types of networks, which would be the best of having a physical network and the best of having a virtual network connected to the business.
#### benefits
* One benefit is that when the network is in use you can get the best of having a physical network with clients and a server and also use a virtual network like a cloud to work with the physical network to allow for more information and a faster communication around the business
 
 * If the virtual network was to go down and was unusable clients on the physical network will still be able to communicate on client still on that network meaning work can continue even if it is on a smaller network then before.

 #### resource implications 
 the resources that are needed for create this network would be the physical components for the physical server which would be the clients, server and the router to connect to the cloud network.
 
 #### communications 
 Communications will be easy to do by being able to communicate with anyone connected to the network (cloud/physical). The speed may be quicker if the target client is on the same physical network as you rather than sending it over the cloud.
 
 #### working practice 
the working practise for this network maybe cause problems because the room for error is larger now that two different types of networks are connected together. A problem may occur on the virtual network which might be not detected by the physical network which may take it a while to be detected and removed.
 
 #### commercial opportunity 
 
 #### information sharing 
Information sharing will become easier on a network because it will allow people to communicate around the world by using the virtual network and they can also communicate around the local network without relying on the virtual network.



## OSI model
### The Physical Layer (Layer 1)1
Layer 1 of the OSI model is named the physical layer because it is physical side of the model that the user sees and it is responsible for transmitting information to the user. This layer mainly acts as the interface to allow for communication for the other layers.
