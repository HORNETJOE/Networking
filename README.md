# Networking

## Network types and standards.

## Different types of networks
 ### Peer-based
 #### benefits
 The main benefit of a peer to peer network is that it is easier to set up. Another in peer-to-peer networks all nodes are act as server as well as client therefore no need of dedicated server. Another benefit of peer to peer network is that is one of the cheapest types of networks to use. Peer to peer network is easier to set up and use this means that you can spend less time in the configuration and implementation of peer to peer network. It is not requiring for the peer to peer network to use the dedicated server computer. Any computer on the network can function as both a network server and a user workstation.

 #### resource implications
 the resources needed to implement a peer to peer network is two or more PC's both with internet connection.
 
 #### communications 
 communications between the two PC's can be anything that can be transferred from one PC to another.
 
 #### working practice 
 The work practise that would need to be done on a peer to peer network will be minimal because a peer to peer network is a simple network that does not have many complex issues or requirements to handle.
 
 #### commercial opportunity 
 Peer to peer networking allows for commercial opportunities such as being able to work with other members of the business by sharing files and data between them seamlessly using the network with little risk of data being intercepted by outside sources.
 
 #### information sharing 
 information can be shared easily on a peer to peer network as long at the receiving and sending PC are on the same network. The information that is being sent does have a chance of being corrupted if it is intercepted by other data during its transit to the receiving PC. 
 
 ### client-server 
A client-server is a network in which many clients are connect to a higher client which acts as a server which directs traffic and connects all the clients together. This is the basic type of client-server network that are most commonly seen in business and organizations.
 #### benefits
There are many benefits to client-server networks. Some of these benefits are:

* All files are stored in a central location

* Network peripherals are controlled centrally

* Backups and network security is controlled centrally

* Users can access shared data which is centrally controlled

#### resource implications 
 The resources that will be needed for this network to be implemented would be the client PC's and a main client to act as the server to connect the network together. The clients are connected to each other and information and data is transmitted from/to each client.
 #### communications 
 Communication on the network works differently than a server network. On a client-server the clients on the network communicate with each other directly.
 #### commercial opportunity 
 The commercial opportunity that client-server offers to business and companies is a simple network connection between each client's PC to allow the exchange of data and information between each client.
 #### information sharing 
 information sharing on a client server is very similar to peer to peer network in which it allows all clients on the server to communicate to each other using data and information which is sent to each client's PC to and from a main client called a server.
 ### cloud
A Cloud network is a virtual network that can be accessed by an internet connection. This cloud network can belong to a private company or an open group and will act as a virtual network for that business with its own vital firewall, server and router. A could network can also be known as an internet based network.
  #### benefits
There are many benefits of using a cloud network. Here are some of the benefits:

* Reduce maintenance cost for upkeep

* The scalability of a cloud network can be nearly endless with the amount of data and information it can hold. Cloud networks don't take up much physical space and still maintaining a massive network size and capacity.

* The cloud allows for easy communication and ease of use when accessing or uploading data to the network from any wireless access point connected to the network.

 #### resource implications
 The resources needed to implement a cloud network are a router to connect an existing network or a device to the cloud network and the hardware needed to host the virtual network on.
 
 #### communications 
 The cloud network will allow for fast and easy ways to communicate from one client's device to another. This is because it is wireless which allows users to communicate from anywhere which is connected to the network through the internet.
 
#### working practice 
 The cloud network allows for a safe working practice because most cloud networks contain a virtual firewall which should protect from any unwanted software. 

#### commercial opportunity 
  There are a lot of commercial opportunity for a business if they own a cloud server they can sell the user of them could network to outside users for a fee. The company will also be allowed to set up anywhere in the world with an internet connection and still access their file and data stored on the cloud.

#### information sharing 
 Information sharing will be allowing easier on a cloud network without needing a wired connection to the network and being able to access the information from anywhere with an internet connection.
 
 ### cluster
A cluster network is a network in which all the nodes (client used as a server) on the network are set to the same task with each one running their own instance of an operating system. The cluster network is similar to most networks however it is more scattered then most networks meaning some device maybe perform the same tasks as other not making it the most efficient network but making it a working network nonetheless.

 #### benefits
 * a cluster server can host more the one server which handles the same task, so if one server was to go down the other server can take its place to prevent any problems until the first server's issue is fix.
 
 * The cluster network is complete scalable which means that it can be used for small networks and large networks by adding more devices or less devices respectively.
 
* When a server is down for maintenance another server can take its position to make maintenance easier while still keeping the network up for the clients.

 #### resource implications 
The resources that are needed to create a cluster network are the clients which access the network one or more servers to direct traffic around the network and a router to connect to other networks.
 
 #### communications 
 communication is like any other network in which a message can be sent from one PC on the network to another PC on the network through the network's server(s).
 
 #### information sharing
information sharing on a cluster network can work like any other network but can be slow at times when multiple packets of data intercept each other by having all the clients connected to each other as well as the server but it could also allow for fast transport for the data package if the destination client in nearby on the system.
 
### centralised
A centralised network is when all clients and devices on the network are connected to a main server. This main server holds all the information on the clients and devise and the conversations that they produce.
 #### resource implications 
 The resources what will be needed for this network to be implemented would be the clients and the main server which holds all the information and communication.
 
#### communications 
 The communications that are created on the network are stored on the main server which handles all the things about the network.
 
 #### working practice 
 The working practice for this network is that all the conversations and information is passed through the server which can them check for any unwanted or inappropriate content allowed on and out of the network.
 #### information sharing 
information can be shared throughout the network but it has to pass through and stored on the main server which can then be seen later on for monetisation and review.
 
### virtualized
 virtualized networks are a mix of both a virtual network and a LAN network (VLAN). These types of networks are common with large corporations which use this network to get the best of both types of networks, which would be the best of having a physical network and the best of having a virtual network connected to the business.
#### benefits
* One benefit is that when the network is in use you can get the best of having a physical network with clients and a server and also use a virtual network like a cloud to work with the physical network to allow for more information and a faster communication around the business
 
 * If the virtual network was to go down and was unusable clients on the physical network will still be able to communicate on client still on that network meaning work can continue even if it is on a smaller network then before.

 #### resource implications 
 the resources that are needed for create this network would be the physical components for the physical server which would be the clients, server and the router to connect to the cloud network.
 
 #### communications 
 Communications will be easy to do by being able to communicate with anyone connected to the network (cloud/physical). The speed may be quicker if the target client is on the same physical network as you rather than sending it over the cloud.
 
 #### working practice 
the working practise for this network maybe cause problems because the room for error is larger now that two different types of networks are connected together. A problem may occur on the virtual network which might be not detected by the physical network which may take it a while to be detected and removed.
 
 #### commercial opportunity 
 
 #### information sharing 
Information sharing will become easier on a network because it will allow people to communicate around the world by using the virtual network and they can also communicate around the local network without relying on the virtual network.

![Models](https://github.com/HORNETJOE/Networking/blob/master/TCP%20OSI%20model.jpg)

## OSI model
### The Physical Layer (Layer 1)1
Layer 1 of the OSI model is named the physical layer because it is physical side of the model that the user sees and it is responsible for transmitting information to the user. This layer mainly acts as the interface to allow for communication for the other layers.
### The Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
The second layer of the OSI model is the data link layer which is responsible for creating a link between the layers. The data link layer is also responsible for error checking and accessing media across the model.
### The Network Layer (Layer 3)
layer 3 of the OSI model is the network layer which where the network traffic is handled. This layer makes routing decisions as well as and provides traffic control in the network.
### The Transport Layer (Layer 4)
The forth layer of the OSI model is the Transport layer which handles traffic in the network and is responsible for message segmentation. the transport layer also makes sure that messages reach their destination and make sure they stay intact and don't lose any information along the way.
### The Session Layer (Layer 5)
The fifth layer is the session layer and this is responsible for session establishment, maintenance and termination.
### The Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
The sixth layer of the OSI model is the Presentation layer and this handles the character code translation (I.E ASCII). It also handles encryption and compression.
### The Application Layer (Layer 7)
The seventh layer of the OSI model is the Application and its purpose will change depepnding on the purpose of the application that it is used for. For example the applciation layer can provide network access to users as well as remote file access to users.
## TCP/IP model

### The Link Layer (Layer 1)
The first layer of the TCP/IP model is the link layer which acts as the interface for the network. This layer is a combination of the physcial layer and the data link layer of the OCI model.
### The Internet Layer (Layer 2)
The Internet layer is the next layer up from the link layer and is associated with the network layer of the OSI model. Functions include traffic routing, traffic control, fragmentation, and logical addressing. 
### The Transport Layer (Layer 3)
The transport layer is the thrid layer The functions are realetd to the OSI model. The functions include traffic control, error ddetection, message recording, message segmentation and acknowledgment.
### The Application Layer (Layer 4)
The forth layer in this model is the application model. In the TCP/IP model the applciation model is used to handle all process-to-process communication functions; these functions were carried out by multible different layers when referencing the OSI model.
## Benefits of TCP/IP and OCI models
| TCP/IP | OSI |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| The TCP/IP model is less reliable because TCP/IP model’s transport layer does not guarantee delivery of packets.  | In OSI model the transport layer guarantees the delivery of packets.  |
| TCP/IP follows horizontal approach.  | OSI follows vertical approach.  |
| TCP/IP does not have a separate Presentation layer or Session layer.  | OSI model has a separate Presentation layer and Session layer.  |
| Transport Layer is both Connection Oriented and Connection less.  | Transport Layer is Connection Oriented.  |
| Network Layer is Connection less than the OSI model.  | Network Layer is both Connection Oriented and Connection less.  |


## working standard and protocols
### IEEE 802.3
IEEE stands for Electrical and Electronics Engineers and it is responsible for defining ethernet-based networks as well as the name of the working group assigned to develop these standards. IEEE 802.3 defines the physical layer and the media access control. It could be stated that the IEEE 802.3 could otherwise be known as the ethernet standard that defines the physical layer on a model.
### IEEE 802.7
This type of IEEE is comelier used for broadband local area networks. This type also focusses on the test parameters, design and installation for a broadband cable medium.
### IEEE 802.8
This type of IEEE is most used for the development practices for fibre optics. in LAN networks. This IEEE is used to configure and test fibre optic local area networks.
### IEEE 802.11
This type of IEEE is sued for developing standards for wireless local area networks. it uses frequency bands to implement wireless local area network computer communication.

## Routed protocols
A routing protocol is how routers communicate with each other. They exchange information that enables them to select routes on that network that would provide the best router for that information. This method only works when both routers know the network they are sending the information through. One type and the most popular type of routing protocol is IP addresses. They are a reason that IP addresses are more popular than other routed protocols.

IPv4 stands for internet protocol version 4 and was one of the core protocols standard-based interworking methods on the internet. However due to the increased population and active users it was running out of address to assign, so another solution was to be implemented to avoid problems. This where IPv6 was introduced which was the sixth version to be created. It had plenty more address so it was to replace IPv4 to fix the problem of the lack of address.

Global unicast is a feature in IPv6 which allows a convenient, publicly routable that can be used on the internet or any public domain that uses and single node. The problem that this causes is that when the data packets are sent they are not sent to the one target destination, instead they are sent across the network to all hosts which could cause major security risks.

## Services and network applications
### FTP
FTP stands for file transfer protocol and it is used for the transfer of computer files and data between a client and a server on a network. FTP is most commonly found on client-server networks can controls and transitions between the server and the client
### HTTP
HTTP stands for Hypertexts Transfer Protocol. This type of protocol is used on the world wide web and it defines how messages are formatted and transmitted across the internet. It also controls how web servers and browsers will act based on various commands.
### SMTP
SMTP stands for Simple mail transfer Protocol and it is mainly used for email transmission. Emails that are sent over the internet use SMTP to have the ability to send the email from one server to another. This has become the standard protocol to use for email services.
### POP
POP stands for Post Office Protocol 3 and is a protocol designed to receive email. This email is the held at your internet server. POP3 works in conjunction with SMTP to complete the transfer of an email to reach another client on another server.
### SSL
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and it is responsible for security over internet communications by using cryptographic methods such as encryption.
## the impact of network topology, communication and bandwidth requirements
### logical
The logical topology is set of fragments that define the arrangement and communication of the nodes on the network. The topology of the network can be maintained dynamically and reconfigured by the topology. The topology handles how the signals and how the data passes through the network and how it is handled on the devices on the network.

#### Ethernet
One type of logical topology is Ethernet. Ehternet is the most used used local area network technology. Ethernet formats how data is transmitted to other network devices on the same network.

### physical 
The Physical topology is the physical hardware of the network such as the clients and the servers on the network as well as the cables connecting them all together. It’s important to layout the network physical to make sure that it is layout out conveniently and does not get in the way of anyone or anything in the room.
### different types of physical topologies
#### Star
The star topology is when all the devices and clients are connected to one central node which would mainly be a hub or switch.
#### Ring
The ring topology is when all the clients and devices on the network are connected to one other devices on that network in a circle layout such as PC1 connected to PC2 and PC2 connect to a server etc. 
#### Bus
The bus topology is when all the clients and devices are connected on a single line which are terminated on both ends.
### the difference
the main difference between the physical and logical is that the logical topology is visualizing the network and the physical topology is how the network is represented in the physical space in a room/environment.
