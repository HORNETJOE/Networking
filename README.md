# Networking

## Network types and standards.

## Different types of networks
 ### Peer-based
 #### benefits
 The main benefit of a peer to peer network is that it is easier to set up. Another in peer-to-peer networks all nodes are act as server as well as client therefore no need of dedicated server. Antoher benefit of peer to peer netork is that is one of the cheipist types of networks to use. Peer to peer network is easier to set up and use this means that you can spend less time in the configuration and implementation of peer to peer network. It is not require for the peer to peer network to use the dedicated server computer. Any computer on the network can function as both a network server and a user workstation.

 #### resource implications
 the reasources needed to impliment a peer to peer network is two or more PC's both with  internet connection.
 
 #### communications 
 communications bettwen the two PC's can  be anything that can be trasnfered from one PC to another.
 
 #### working practice 
 The work practise that would need to be done on a peer to peer network will be minimal beucase a peer to peer netowkr is a simple network that does not have many camplex issues or requirments to handle.
 
 #### commercial opportunity 
 Peer to peer networking allows for commercial opportunities such as being able to work with other members of the business by sharing files and data between them seemplesly using the network with little risk of data being intercepted by outside sources.
 
 #### information sharing 
 infomation can be shared easily on a peer to peer nerwork as long at the reciving and sending PC are on the same network. The infomation that is being sent does have a chnace of being curupted if it is intercepted by other data during its transit to the reciving PC.
